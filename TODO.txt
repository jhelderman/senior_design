Beamforming To-Do List
Delay-Sum Beamforming:
#Fix the delay issue
-Test to ensure the delay issue is fixed
#Plot Directivity pattern for Delay-Sum Beamformer
-Test Simulation of the Delay-Sum Beamformer for the weights/delays given in 
 the Cohen presentation

Filter-Sum Beamforming:
#Identify a good example to use (umd link: superdirective beamforming)
#Write a simulation for the example
-Test the simulation of the example
#Write a simulation for the directivity pattern
-Test the simulation of the directivity pattern

Sub-array Beamforming:
-Write a simulation for a sub-array beamformer that achieves a similar/the same
 directivity pattern for all frequency ranges determined by the sub-arrays
-Test the simulation

General Beamforming Simulation:
#Find a way to model a source
#Find a way to model the spatial setup, i.e. figure out how to incorporate the 
 natural delay from the source to each microphone in the array.
